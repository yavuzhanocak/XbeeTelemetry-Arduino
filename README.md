# XbeeTelemetry-Arduino
Telemetry on Electrical Cars
Transfers temperature, speed, battery data from car on Xbee modules.
This is the XBee XB24-Z7WIT-004 module from Digi. Series 2 improves on the power output and data protocol. Series 2 modules allow you to create complex mesh networks based on the XBee ZB ZigBee mesh firmware. These modules allow a very reliable and simple communication between microcontrollers, computers, systems, really anything with a serial port! Point to point and multi-point networks are supported.

These are essentially the same hardware as the older Series 2.5, but have updated firmware. They will work with Series 2.5 modules if you update the firmware through X-CTU.
# for XBee 2mW Wire Antenna - Series 2 (ZigBee Mesh)

    *3.3V @ 40mA
    *250kbps Max data rate
    *2mW output (+3dBm)
    *400ft (120m) range
    *Built-in antenna
    *Fully FCC certified
    *6 10-bit ADC input pins
    *8 digital IO pins
    *128-bit encryption
    *Local or over-air configuration
    *AT or API command set



# Configuration
Note that in the diagram above only 4 wires are connected (GND, 5V, Transmit, Receiver). The CTS and RTS (Ready-to-send) pins are left unconnected because although connecting them should improve the data rate during the creation of this wiki page we were unable to successfully connect.
